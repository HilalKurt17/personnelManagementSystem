# Personnel Management System
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personnel Management System is designed and developed for small-sized companies. The project is developed using C# with .NET 6. Windows Form is used to create the user interfaces of the project. MSSQL Server database is utilized to store personnel data. ADO.NET is used to connect the project with the MSSQL Server database.    
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two different sign in types are defined in the project as personnel sign in and manager sign in. There are two different authority level in manager form, two and three. 
  - Managers with authority level three have access to all features of the system including listing all personnels, adding new personnel, editing personnel, assigning new duty to personnel, assigning a manager for a personnel, listing all manager-personnel pairs, assigning new duties to themselves, viewing their own duties in detail and approving their duties.
    
  - Managers with authority level two can view their duty list, a duty in detail, list of personnel and assign new duties and approve existing duties for the personnel they supervise.
    
  - In the personnel form, personnels can list their duties and view a duty in detail. Completed duties will be sent to the personnel's manager. On the other hand, personnel sign in form is used for registration of new personnel into the system.
